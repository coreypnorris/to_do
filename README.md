##to_do

####This is a ruby method keeping track of tasks you need to get done.

To use it just copy the code from the lib/list.rb file and paste it into a ruby client and hit enter ([Here's a link](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/installing-ruby) that helped me install ruby on my machine). You will also need to enter the code from the lib/task.rb file as well. After those methods are entered you can use these commands in the ruby client.

`list-name` = List.new(`list-description`) to create a new list.
`task-name` = Task.new(`task-description`) to create a new task.
`list-name`.add_task(`task-name`) to add a task to a list.
`list-name`.tasks to see all the tasks in a list.


We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/parcels-triangles-to-do) was meant to introduce us to writing our own ruby methods.
